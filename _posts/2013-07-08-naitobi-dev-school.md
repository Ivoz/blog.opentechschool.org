Since I joined the group of [AfricaHackTrip](http://africahacktrip.org/), developers and designers from Europe visting tech hubs in East Africa this fall, I learned about many great initiatives in the area, some of them being a perfect fit for my involvement in OpenTechSchool.

I'd like to draw your attention to a special project: Nairobi Dev School. Martha Chumo, a 19 year-old girl, is building a school to teach coding, particularly encouraging women to participate and offering financial support to those who need it. She's running a [campaign on Indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nairobi-dev-school) to be able to rent a place, buy furniture and laptops that needs your donation! Here's [another article](http://geekfeminism.org/2013/06/26/martha-chumo-founding-nairobi-dev-school/). Also check out [her blog](http://nchelimo.blogspot.de).

Apart from that there's also [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com) going on a lot of other things. Take a look at the blog [Girl Geek Kampala](http://girlgeekkampala.com) to get an impression. I'm looking forward to meet some of the protaginists in person.

Seems as if OpenTechSchool and AfricaHackTrip share some values and could benefit from each other. I'm looking into ways how these projects can promote each other more. Maybe there will be chapters in African cities soon? Leave a comment of you have ideas.
