Enter the world of social coding with Git and GitHub! In this course
we introduce you to GitHub, a free online service where over 2 million
developers from around the world share their code. We'll show you how
to share your code, meet like-minded programmers and participate in
other projects. You can even host simple websites using GitHub.
Whether you just want to share a little script, connect with fellow
programmers or contribute to some of the largest and most dynamic
software projects in the world, we'll show you how to get started!

This course requires no previous knowledge of Git and is suitable for
beginners of any programming language. No programming will be required
during the course, but feel free to bring along your code for sharing
on GitHub. You will need to bring your own laptop.

The course will be held Saturday November 3rd, from 12pm to 4pm at
[Co.Up](http://co-up.de/) Berlin. RSVPs will open on October 24th at
the
[OTS Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/87029482/)
for the event. If you would like to contribute as a coach (no coaching
exprerience necessary!) Then please join the OTS
[Git coaches mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/coaches.git).
