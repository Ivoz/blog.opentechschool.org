On October 13th, it was time to premiere one of our highlights in the
the Swedish capital. The very first workshop we had as OTS, now
organized on the same date in both Berlin AND Stockholm: JS for
Absolute Beginners (JSfAB!).

The venue: the wonderful Omnicloud HQ in Gamla stan, the Old Town,
just around the corner from the Royal Castle and with a spectacular
view of the city.

Full house, the first cup of coffee of the day, set up the ongoing
Google hangout with Berlin, and we were ready to go.

Coaches coaching, learners trying out their first experiments with JS
– so much enthusiasm in the air. Smileys coded on the screens and
smiling faces when we get to the Swedish fika time (break and warm
kanelbulle for everybody!). And then on for a whole day of coding and
high fives. And we also had a special guest joining us: hej Henrietta
from Rails Girls!

It was fantastic, and we can’t wait to organize more events in town.

Our warmest thank you to the Omnicloud team for the great venue,
drinks and fresh fruit (bananas were the fruit of the day!), all our
coaches, and Salton, the office cat. See you soon for the next
workshop!
