This was the first evening tutorial for the OpenTechSchool Python
Beginners program. We had a great turnout, lots of beginners from all
sorts of backgrounds coming to learn how to search Twitter using
Python.

This was very much a data-centric tutorial, with most of the evening
being dedicated to learning the ins and outs of Python lists and
dictionaries. The Twitter Search API showed itself to be particular
good as an example service, being both easy-to-use and quite popular.

Sometimes, though, the data coming back was a little difficult to read:

But with help from our new favourite module,
[pprint](http://docs.python.org/library/pprint), we managed to make a
little sense out of it all.
