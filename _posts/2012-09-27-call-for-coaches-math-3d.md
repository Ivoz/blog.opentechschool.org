Animation and visualisation is nice look at, but not that easy to produce. Especially when you are missing the math background. That is why the OpenTechSchool would love to host a workshop about math in visualisation and 3D. In order to do that we need help, that is why we are calling for Math-3D Coaches.

So if you have knowledge in Math and/or visualisation and you'd like to share with us and learners interested in the topic, or if you just feel confident enough to coach one or more math or visualisation libraries out there, please sign up to our Math-3d coaches mailinglist below.
