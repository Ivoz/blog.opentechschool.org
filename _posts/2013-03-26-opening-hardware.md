title: "Hic sunt dracones: opening and repairing hardware"
teaser: "Most people are using a lot of mobile electronic devices throughout the day. We know roughly how to use them and summon them with the right commands like little deamons. Sometimes they do not obey and we try to cajole them by praying, pleading and cursing. Maybe even hitting.  But your device does not have to be a black box labeled »[Hic sunt dracones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)« to you! 
We at the [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/) know that the idea of dragons may be daunting sometimes. Hence we will give a workshop about literally opening hardware. Come and discover the inside of devices and what they are actually made of in a beginner-friendly environement! We will show you how to open things by yourself and try to answer all questions. Feel free to bring your own devices, especially broken ones. We will not only try to teach you how to open but also how to fix them. You don’t need any experience, everyone is very welcome.

Most people are using a lot of mobile electronic devices throughout the day. We know roughly how to use them and summon them with the right commands like little deamons. Sometimes they do not obey and we try to cajole them by praying, pleading and cursing. Maybe even hitting.  But your device does not have to be a black box labeled »[Hic sunt dragones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons)« to you! 
We at the [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/) know that the idea of dragons may be daunting sometimes. Hence we will give a workshop about literally opening hardware. Come and discover the inside of devices and what they are actually made of in a beginner-friendly environement! We will show you how to open things by yourself and try to answer all questions. Feel free to bring your own devices, especially broken ones. We will not only teach you how to open but also how to fix them. You don’t need any experience, everyone is very welcome.

### Why?

* Because it is fun.
* To let you regain some souvereignity about your devices and live. All the magic gadgets are just a combination of understandable parts and you will find out what things actually are made of besides software.
* To facilitate the reuse of electronic devices. Broken mobile devices are often trashed when just a part is broken (hands up, if you have a phone with a broken screen dusting in a drawer) or the built-in battery is dying. Spare parts are rather cheap (touchscreens ca. 25 €, batteries 10 €, buttons below 2 €) and the recycling rate of electronic waste is embarrassing. At the same time, the mining of rare earths, gold and other materials for electronics is causing and financing several wars, as well as severe social and environmental damages.
* Nicolai is still hoping to find a real dragon. He wants to keep it as a pet animal. He gets dibs on any dragon found.

### What do I need to bring?

Bring yourself. Come as you are. There is nothing you absolutely need to bring and nothing you need to know in advance. 
You may try to limit your caffeine consumption on the workshop day to avoid shaky hands.
If you have special needs regarding your hearing, sight or motor skills, you may contact us beforehand, so we can figure out how to make this workshop more accessible for you.

### What could I bring?

If you want to, you could bring one or more of these things:
* Any device you want to open or repair (laptops, tablets, netbooks, smartphones, dumbphones, ebookreaders, electrical toothbrushes, …)
* a thin plastic item to be used as an opening tool. For example a plectrum, a ruler, a dummy sd-card from your laptop, …
* a paper clip, pin or thin needle
* a toothpick
* small screwdrivers
* a magnifier
* a working device to look up repair manuals, videos or replacement parts. A smartphone, laptop or tablet will do.
* multi-component adhesive
* instant adhesive

### Bring your own devices

If you want to repair your own device, you might need a replacement part. Just bring your device to the first workshop and we will figure out together, what you might need and where to buy it. You may then order the part yourself and bring it with the device to the second workshop meeting a few weeks later (we wait a little to give parcels from china a chance) to finally assembly it.

We refuse to be responsible for any damage to devices you brought with you. We will let you sign a small paper to release us from any liability. We do this to avoid lawsuits and trouble. So far everything was less broken after we touched it then before, but who knows what the future brings? We also deny any liability for potential damages by potential dragons.
