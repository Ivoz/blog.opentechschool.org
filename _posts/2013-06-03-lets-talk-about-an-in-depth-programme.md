We already announced it on [codemotion](/2013/05/presenting-at-codemotion-the-state-of-tech-education.html): **the [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org) is looking into offering longer, in-depth learning programmes**.

And though we have already some ideas on what and how to do it, we want your input on this. After all it is the biggest we've been looking into yet, which doesn't only mean much more work for us but also much more responsibilities and things to take into account. And we really don't have any interest in building something no one wants or doesn't work. That is why we are asking you, to help us figure things out.

So if you could take the six minutes and **[answer this short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Lvg9FdynasP9oj5Kn_bRK3Ym9xFf_FByKECHK_8aijs/viewform)**, that would help us a lot and is highly appreciated. And of course we'll keep you updated on its involves, too.

Thank you very much
