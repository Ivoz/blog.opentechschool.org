Prior to this announcement we wracked our brains and discussed a lot. But since creating a longer, more in-depth learning programm would be our biggest project so far, we really want your input now. After all, a project of this size means much more responsibilities and day-to-day work than one of our weekend workshops. 

As always we care most about the learning experience of our participants so we want to make it right from the start. You can help us succeed by taking six minutes of your time and [answer this short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Lvg9FdynasP9oj5Kn_bRK3Ym9xFf_FByKECHK_8aijs/viewform).


Thank you for helping us figure out how to make tech education better!
