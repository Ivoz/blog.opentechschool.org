We are very happy to welcome another three local teams into the global OpenTechSchool Community: Tel-Aviv and Ramallah both in the middle east and Dortmund, in the Ruhrgebiet and as such the so far the farthest we got west (in Germany).

Tel-Aviv, the startup and tech capital of young Israel wasn't to hard to convince. Quite the opposite not fewer than twelve people came to the kick-off meeting after the first Python Workshop to become part of a local Team. And within this month they already grew by another three members and hosted another two events. That local team is busy, too busy to get a team page ready before this Blog post. But who needs that if [the meetups](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-tel-aviv/) are fully booked every time and they are already supported by local Coworking Space [Hamifal](http://hamifal.com/) and Google allows them to use [their Campus](http://www.campustelaviv.com/) for the workshops.

Also in the lesser known startup and tech centre on the other side of the wall [Ramallah](http://www.opentechschool.org/ramallah) the seed fell on fruitful ground. The first OpenTechSchool Workshop on Arabic Grounds, the python workshop at Exalt, though set up on a very short notice of just two days in advance, was a huge success. And inspired locals to continue the work, they will be back after a little break for Ramadan soon. Join their meetup-page to stay up to date and write [Hosam](mailto:hosam[at]opentechschool[dot]org), if you want to help organising more events in Palestine.

Similar goes for the next chapter in Germany: [Dortmund](http://www.opentechschool.org/dortmund/), the first local team in lovely Ruhrgebiet will be joining the OpenTechSchool with their [official Kick-Off event on September 3rd](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-dortmund/events/124311122/). If you are around and interested in helping out, [please come join](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-dortmund/events/124311122/). And though the local chapter hasn't officially launched yet, the members are already actively discussing on creating more and extended materials. For example on creating material for an HTML5 & CSS workshop following the workshop the Berlin Chapter co-hosted with the RailsGirls as s Satellite Event of TechOpenAir-Berlin this year.
