We are very happy to welcome three more local teams to the global OpenTechSchool Community: [Tel-Aviv](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-tel-aviv/) and [Ramallah](http://www.opentechschool.org/ramallah/) - both in the middle east and [Dortmund](http://www.opentechschool.org/dortmund/) in lovely Ruhrgebiet, so far the farthest west (in Germany). 

### Tel-Aviv

People in Tel-Aviv, the startup and tech capital of Israel didn't need much convincing. Quite the opposite, nothing less than twelve people came to [the kick-off meeting](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-tel-aviv/events/125913422/) after the [first Python Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-tel-aviv/events/123856622/) to become part of a local team. And within the first month they already grew by another three members and hosted the same workshop another two times. That local team is busy, too busy to get a team page ready before this blog post even. But who needs that if [the meetups](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-tel-aviv/) are fully booked every time and they are already supported by local coworking space [Hamifal](http://hamifal.com/) and Google allowing them to use [their Campus](http://www.campustelaviv.com/) for the workshops. Keep on rocking.

### Ramallah

Also in [Ramallah](http://www.opentechschool.org/ramallah/), the lesser known startup and tech centre at the other side of the wall  the seed fell on fertile ground. The first OpenTechSchool workshop on arabic soil, the [Python Workshop at Exalt](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-ramallah/events/126366562/), though set up on a very short notice of just two days in advance, was a huge success. And inspired locals to continue the work, coming back with more workshops after a short Ramadan break now. Join [the meetup-page to stay up](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-ramallah/) to date and write [Hosam](mailto:hosam[at]opentechschool[dot]org), if you want to help organising more events in Palestine.

### Dortmund

Similar goes for the next chapter in Germany: [Dortmund](http://www.opentechschool.org/dortmund/), the first local team in lovely Ruhrgebiet will be joining the OpenTechSchool with their [official Kick-Off event on September 3rd](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-dortmund/events/124311122/). If you are around and interested in helping out, [please come join](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-dortmund/events/124311122/). And though the local chapter hasn't officially launched just yet, the team is already actively discussing on creating more and extended materials. For example about creating material for an HTML5 & CSS workshop following the workshop the [Berlin team co-hosted](https://twitter.com/OTS_BLN/status/363307157799698436) with the RailsGirls as a satellite event of TechOpenAir-Berlin two weeks ago.
