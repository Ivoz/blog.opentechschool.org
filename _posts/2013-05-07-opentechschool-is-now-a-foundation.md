The [OpenTechSchool e.V.](http://www.opentechschool.org/foundation/) has officially been [established](http://www.opentechschool.org/foundation/archive/Vereinsgruendungsprotokoll.pdf) on January 5th, 2013 and [registered](http://www.opentechschool.org/foundation/archive/Register_Bestaetigung.pdf) on March 25th, 2013.

What does that mean for us all, our community?

The OpenTechSchool movement and initiatives will essentially stay the same. We created the foundation to empower our community, and simplify some process that require a legal entity, such as sponsoring.

But that also means that anybody can [join the the foundation](https://docs.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGYycmhYal9SSW1WRUdQcUhUSk9FYWc6MQ#gid=0) as a member and support us by doing so with a 2€ monthly membership fee. Notice that as before, no membership will be required to take part in our activities, whether as a coach or as a learner. All our workshops and events are still free for everyone to attend.

If you want to support us even further you also now accept donations.
