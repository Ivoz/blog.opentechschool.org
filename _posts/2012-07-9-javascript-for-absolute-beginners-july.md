A mere 24 hours after the first tweet was sent about the July 21/22 JavaScript workshop, registration for the event has ended. We are very happy to have such a positive response and hope that following workshops will be open to more participants. You can help make this happen: no matter if youâ€™ve never coached before, we are looking for people who know JS and want to give teaching a chance. We promise you will find it worthwhile.
