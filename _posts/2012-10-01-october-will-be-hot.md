First of, we'll host the [Javascript for Absolute Beginners Workshop weekend](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool/events/84329602/) again:  on the 13th and 14th of October we invite you to join us at Co.Up for some awesome code learning. But this time **we'll also host day one together as a joint event** in [Stockholm](!!!!). So if you happen to a be around and would like to help us coach [join the conversation up here](http://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/group/discuss.stockholm). We are very excited to expand our movement to this lovely place and once again starting off with our awesome JS workshop is just amazing. But that shouldn't be the only OTS event in Stockholm - we are currently planning to host at least another workshop and our first Beginners Meetup there later this month. Join our very own [OTS-Stockholm meetup](http) group to stay informed. And if you'd like to help us implement OTS there permanently, join the conversion.

And there is more: just in a few days, we'll host the [Beginners Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool/events/84138972/) in Berlin again and I am very excited about our weekly [Micro Hack Day](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool/events/84336562/) sessions we are gonna kick off this saturday, Oct 6th: Every saturday a few of us get together in a public bar/caf√©/restaurant to hack on our projects and we'd like to invite you to join. The idea is to to be around people hacking on code, share ideas and thoughts and discuss tech problems or things you are stuck with yourself. Unlike other hacking sessions this is **explicitly open to beginners who are working on their first projects** or through some online course, they can do mostly on their own but might get stuck with. Then we are there to help.

On top we are also looking into creating workshops on [git](https://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/coaches.git) and [Math-3D](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2012/09/call-for-coaches-math-3d.html) (coach [sign up here](http://groups.google.com/a/opentechschool.org/group/coaches.math-3d)). So if you are interested in either one (or both), join the conversation(s) and let's make it happen.
