Alongside all of our hard work to bring you lots of interesting workshops at <a href='http://bit.ly/OTS-camp' target='_blank'>Campus Party</a>, a dedicated team of Python coaches and OTS organizers have been busy planning a new workshop. On September 1st, you will have the chance to attend a four hour introduction to Python, starting at 14:00. This introduction will cover programming basics using <a href='http://pythonturtle.org/' target='_blank'>PythonTurtle</a>, and is suited for anyone with a basic knowledge of how to use a computer. The workshop will take place at co.up; all you need to participate is a laptop! We will be having an installation party on the evening before (at 19:00 in <a href='http://co-up.de/about.html#location' target='_blank'>co.up</a>) in order to get everyone's computer set up with Python 2.7 and ready for the following day.

 Because of the diverse backgrounds and interests of our coaches, the follow up workshops will have a wide variety of more specific uses for this programming language: Python for biologists, web development with Django, etc. More information about these workshops will be made available as soon as possible.
You can sign up for the workshop via the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool/events/77514812/' target='_blank'>OTS Meetup page</a>, opening tonight at 6pm. There are only 40 seats, so it's important for us that you really attend if you sign up, and if not, make sure to cancel your attendance on Meetup so someone else can take your place.

We look forward to seeing you on August 31st for the installation party, and September 1st for the workshop!
