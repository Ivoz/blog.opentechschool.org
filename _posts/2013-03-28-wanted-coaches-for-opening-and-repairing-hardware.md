# Dear handy people,

Opentechschool has done a lot of good workshops but not much hardware related ones. I would like to change that and start with a very simple and beginner friendly workshop about opening (mostly mobile) hardware: Laptops, mobile phones, etc â€¦

To make this workshop fun for everyone we would like to avoid swanking, making a show of ones knowledge/ability and mansplaining. Basically the athmosphere of a macho DIY-bycicle-repair shop.
I expect the participants to need some help and would love to serve as many as comfortably possible. Hence we look for more coaches. If you are patient, beginner-respecting and want to help us helping others, you would be more than welcome to do so. You do not need to know everything about hardware, but have some experience in opening it. To give you an idea about the class, read this [future blogpost](https://github.com/scallo/blog.opentechschool.org/blob/9253d4a4930a6e018a2599936ac952090582f5a6/_posts/2013-03-26-opening-hardware.md) targeted at the participants.

Send me an email if you are interested,

Nicolai
