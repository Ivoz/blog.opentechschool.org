Through the [Hive-Network](http://hiveberlin.tumblr.com/) we recently came together with [Sebastian Seitz](http://s-seitz.de/) from the [Technologie Stiftung Berlin (TSB)](http://www.tsb-berlin.de/). He is supervising the project "Make IT real" and one of the things they are organising there are so called "Student Labs" here in Berlin: a place set up to facilitate a whole class of pupils or students and make a half- or even full-day workshops dedicated to teach tech topics. And the OpenTechSchool would like to help with that.

That is why we are announcing today the Berlin Student Labs mailing list and invite you to join to stay up to date on this topic. As of now, the TSB already secured four different venues that can and want to host such workshops, but what is still needed are **coaches as well as content** and some material around that (for e.g. some USB-live-Distros). So if you are interested to coach coding, design or hardware topics to students and pupils - not necessarily all German - please join this mailing list and we'll keep you up to date.
