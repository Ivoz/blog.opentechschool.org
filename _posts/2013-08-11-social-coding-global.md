[Social Coding with Git](http://opentechschool.github.io/social-coding/) has been a popular workshop in Berlin and Sweden. Authored by Steven Farlie, the original workshop introduced participants to git and then encouraged them to take to github and contribute to the "Berlin Underground" network of fine bars, cafes and restaurants.

Yesterday OTS Melbourne took the Berlin Underground global with an updated workshop that applies to any city, anywhere in the world!

Big thanks to our generous hosts at Electron Workshop for the space, co-organisers Steven & Matt for the delicious cookies, and coaches Danni & Alec.
