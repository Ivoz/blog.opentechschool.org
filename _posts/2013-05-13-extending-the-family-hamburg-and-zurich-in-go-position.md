After the successful launch of OpenTechSchool Austrilia, we are very happy to announce another two local teams joining the always extending OpenTechSchool movement: [Hamburg](http://www.opentechschool.org/hamburg/) and [Zurich](http://www.opentechschool.org/zurich/). And not only is the kick-off event already set up, no the first workshops and events are on schedule in those cities already, too. 

## Hamburg

![Diana](http://www.opentechschool.org/images/team/diana.jpg){.team .right} [Team Hamburg](http://www.opentechschool.org/hamburg/) was initiated by Diana, who learnt about the OpenTechSchool when she participated in the [Berlin Geekettes Hackathon](/2013/01/ots-and-the-berlin-geekettes-hackathon.html) earlier this year. Inspired by this experience she contacted the OpenTechSchool Team in Berlin about setting up an OTS in Hamburg.


![App Summer Camp ](http://app-summer-camp.opentechschool.org/assets/flyer_web.gif){.thumb .left} And she already had a concrete project in mind, too: the [App Summer Camp](http://app-summer-camp.opentechschool.org/) Hamburg, taking place 16.-19. Juli, is a full week program in which teenage girls will learn to code and publish their first mobile app. And it will also be the first project OpenTechSchool Hamburg. The official OTS Team Kick-off will take place the week before, July 11th at ThoughtWorks [and can be found on meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-hamburg/events/115518512/).

## Zurich

![Robert](http://www.opentechschool.org/images/team/robert.jpg){.team .right} Our dearest Python Coach and one of the main authors behind the great python beginners learners material recently went to Zurich to work in the Search Team at Google - say what? - and decided to take the OpenTechSchool with him. A few weeks in, he has proven there is an interest for such a learning community indeed and [the team](http://www.opentechschool.org/zurich/) had their [kick off meeting on May 5th](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-zurich/events/116036042/). 

And the first workshop is on the schedule as well already, [Colab](http://colab-zurich.ch/) is willing to host the Python Beginners for a Saturday afternoon and [Robert is currently compiling a list of coaches and their available dates](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-zurich/messages/boards/thread/34200822) in order to find the best date to host as many learners as possible. So if you are from around or will be there at some point, please put your information in the corresponding [doodle](http://doodle.com/hid8nn9p73tydyv4).


Exciting times!
