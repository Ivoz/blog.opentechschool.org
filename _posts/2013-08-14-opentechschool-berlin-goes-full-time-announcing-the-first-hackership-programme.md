title: "OpenTechSchool Berlin goes full time: announcing the first Hackership programme"
author: ben
teaser: "We've already talked about us investigating on in-depth programmes before, but now it is official: The OpenTechSchool in Berlin will offer a full-time learning Programme called Hackership. Similar to the programme the Hacker School in New York is running, Hackership is a 4-days-per-week self-directed peer-learning programme going for several weeks to become a better programmer."

We've already announced that we are looking into offering a more in-depth programme [back in May at Codemotion ](/2013/05/presenting-at-codemotion-the-state-of-tech-education.html) but thanks [to feedback and input of the community](/2013/06/lets-talk-about-an-in-depth-programme.html) we now also know what we want to do specifically: we call it [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/).

![Hackership Teaser](/assets/content/hackership-teaser.png)

[Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/) is a full-time, self-directed peer learning programme for coders to become better hackers. As every experienced coder knows there is no better way to really learn than getting knee deep into the mud and hack on and experiment with the new technology for a while until you really got it. Inspired by the [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) in New York, [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/) tries to provide an environment for exactly that by bringing together people, who want to learn the same thing, create a distraction-free, learning focussed environment and provide the guidance and help through experts in the field - we call them "Hackers in Residence".

You can learn more about the concept of [Hackership on the website](http://www.hackership.org/) or through [this presentation](http://hackership.github.io/slides/presentations/hackership/?full#Cover). Hackership Berlin is scheduled to start in **Winter 2013/2014** and will accept applications as soon as the last details are figured out (we are still looking for a good venue to host the programme).

### Part of a larger OpenTechSchool vision
So in a nutshell, OpenTechSchool now offers 3 approaches for 3 experience levels: beginners' workshops, continuous learning groups for intermediate learners, and Hackership for more experienced programmers.

The **beginners' workshop** have been running since the creation of the OpenTechSchool in various topics and formats such as Javascript for Absolute Beginners (a week-end workshop), Python (for which a constantly growing series of workshops to be run over the months is built), Android development, Arduino and more are in the pipeline. Those allow anyone with any background -- especially total beginners -- to get started with a technology of their choice. They follow a tutorial approach, with precise steps to follow while encouraging learners to experiment and create something that was not in the tutorial (usually towards the end of the workshop).

We recently introduced the concept of **continuous learning groups**, which we are experimenting on for a while in Berlin already: there are currently two groups, one on [Python](add link to meetup group) and one on [Javascript](add link to meetup group), meeting on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to code and learn together in those fields. People work together and learn from each other or by asking the coaches, who are around and help out in any topic they know. They do not have a schedule, structure nor a pre-defined programme you have to follow, allowing everyone to come and learn when they can at the pace they are comfortable with and on the subjects they like. And as this works after hours and is again totally volunteer run, there is no requirement to quit your job nor pay a large tuition to get better at coding. We see this as a way to keep people learning continuously until they are good enough (in their opinion) to tackle their problem, project or apply for the desired position.

And now **[Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/)** provides a similar experience but for more experienced developers, for coders that are already proficient enough to judge by themselves whether a source is a good one and if they are making progress. No need for coaches per se anymore, but instead experts provide them insights in the deepest and most complex aspects of those topics, much faster than if they were by themselves. And the time component is key too: we secure the time and space for these hackers to be able to learn full-time with other like-minded people by again experimenting/hacking together. 

So if these are different programmes they are all based on the same core concepts and values of OpenTechSchool: learning from each others, by doing, at your own pace, in a safe and welcoming learning environment. This is also why it should be easy for anyone to go from one to the other, be a learner in one and a coach in another, and maybe even volunteer to help organise the third.

### Get involved!
Before the first full batch this Winter we are organising a volunteer-run trial batch of six weeks starting early November and finishing before the holiday break. It might not run entirely like the full program (for a start it will be shorter) but we want to use it as a sandbox to implement, experiment on, adapt, but also document and share the main processes and ideas we have for Hackership. 

If you want to participate in this trial batch sign up for the [mailing-list](add details here), there is still room for volunteers, Hackers in Residence and even a few participants.
