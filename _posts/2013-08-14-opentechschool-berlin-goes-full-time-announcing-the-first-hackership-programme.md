teaser: "We've already talked about us investigating on in-depth programmes before, but now it is official: The OpenTechSchool in Berlin will offer a full-time learning Programme called Hackership. Similar to the programme the Hacker School in New York is running, Hackership is a 4-days-per-week self-directed peer-learning programme going for several weeks to become a better hacker."

We've already announced that we are looking into offering a more in-depth programme [back in May at Codemotion ](/2013/05/presenting-at-codemotion-the-state-of-tech-education.html) but thanks [to feedback and input of the community](/2013/06/lets-talk-about-an-in-depth-programme.html) we now also know what we want to do specifically: we call it [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/).

![Hackership Teaser](/assets/content/hackership-teaser.png)

[Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/) is a full-time, self-directed peer learning programme for coders to become better hackers. As every experience coder knows there is no better way to really learn than getting knee deep into the mud and hack on and experiment with the new technology for a while until you really got it. Inspired by the [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) in New York, [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/) tries to provide an environment for exactly that by bringing together people, who want to learn the same thing, create a distraction-free, learning focussed environment and provide the guidance and help through experts in the field - we call them "Hackers in Residence".

You can learn more about the concept of [Hackership on the website](http://www.hackership.org/) or through [this presentation](http://hackership.github.io/slides/presentations/hackership/?full#Cover) (you can also find on the website). Hackership Berlin is scheduled to start in **Winter 2013/2014** and will accept applications as soon as the last details are figured out (we are still looking for a good venue to host the programme).

### Continuous Learning
The way [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/) is build, it only works for coders, who are already proficient enough to judge themselves whether a source is a good and they are making progress. Which is great for experienced coders but not for beginners. And while we are offering Workshop for total Beginners in various fields already, we were missing a way to keep people learning continuously until they are good enough (in their opinion) to tackle their problem or apply for the desired position. And although there are plenty of programmes to get a learner to a junior coder level in the U.S. we decided that they operate do not work with our values of safe learning environment and learning at your own pace.

That is why we decided to go a different way with the concept of continuous learning groups, which we are experimenting on for a while in Berlin already: there are currently two groups, one on Python and one on Javascript, meeting rather often to just code and learn together in those fields. People work together and learn from each other or by asking the coaches, who are around and help out any topic they can. Similar to the Hackership this also doesn't have schedule, structure nor a pre-defined programme you have to follow. Allowing everyone to come and learn when they can at the pace they are comfortable with and on the subjects they like. And as this works after hours and is again totally volunteer run, there is no requirement to quit your job nor pay a large tuition to get better at coding.
