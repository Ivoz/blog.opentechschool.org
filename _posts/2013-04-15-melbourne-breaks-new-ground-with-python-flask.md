It was a sunny Autumn day in Melbourne, perfect weather for a bit of indoor hacking!

This time students had the first crack at our [Websites with Python Flask](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/) workshop. It was a gentle introduction to building websites, covering the basics of web browsers, HTML and CSS. One of the great advantages of [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is that it is very simple to use at first, and still contains everything you need to make a contemporary website.

Overall it was a great success! Many students had never built a website before, and now with Flask under their belts they can take their ideas and put them on the web. With a great number of links to extra resources they can continue their learning after the workshop.
