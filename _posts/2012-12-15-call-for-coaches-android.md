First released in November 2007 the mobile operating system [Android](http://www.android.com/) grew from a niche competitor to the dominating system used by a variety of device manufacturers and most important products of Google.

As smartphone usage rises people are getting more more interested in app and how they are being created. Our workshop for beginners will aim to enable the learners to create their very first Android app. For this **we need qualified coaches** who think they can teach according to [our coaching guide](http://opentechschool.github.com/slides/presentations/coaching/) and can answer typical beginners questions during the first steps of Android development.

The group of coaches will then agree on a curriculum and a specific date but we aim to have this workshop in mid February.

If you are up to challenge and like to inspire others to build more awesome Android apps please join the mailing list for coaches below.
