Arduino - a small micro controller conquers the world. And we want to help it. Not only because we've been asked a lot about hardware workshops for that device but also because we think it is just amazing what you can do with it. But we need help - help by experienced Arduino and hardware people, who want to share their passion with other by coaching.

There is a wide range of workshops and tutorials for Arduino out there. And there are plenty of people willing to learn but afraid to get started or knowing what to do. But it requires good coaches picking the right material or maybe even altering it so that it becomes usable for real hardware beginners, it requires their passion for this device and their experience and expertise to get along well and not be stuck quickly. That is why the OpenTechSchool is calling for Arduino Coaches.

So, if you have knowledge of Arduino and are interested to share its awesomeness with others, please join our mailing list and lets get started.
