We began with Pere Urbón Bayes's Cooking Software 101, a high level
overview of computing from it's mathematical origins to modern day
algorithms. With only 20 minutes to cover such an incredibly broad
field it leaves a lot of pointers for beginners to explore areas of
programming that they haven't seen before. A browse through the slides
is highly recommended.

Pere has also provided some extra links for people interested in
learning more:

* [Handbook of Algorithms and Data Structures](http://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~rbaeza/handbook/hbook.html)
* [Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures](http://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/)
* [Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs)

Next up we had Simon Jocker's Web Standards 101. Simon introduced the
fundamental concepts of current web standards: structured documents
with HTML and styling with CSS. We also got to enjoy a bit of a
history lesson with some classic 1990s web design. They just don't
make them like they used to!

Simon also recommends that beginners check out the [Mozilla Developer
Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn), a great place for
beginners to start learning about the web. This is run by the people
behind the Firefox web browser, so they really know their stuff.

We rounded out the evening with round-table discussions on any topic
that people wanted to discuss. It was great hearing about all the
different things people were trying in their spare time. We even got
a chance to do a little advanced turtling after our Python Beginners
workshop:
