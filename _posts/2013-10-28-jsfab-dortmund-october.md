Dortmund is one of the new outposts of the OpenTechSchool. On the 12th and 13th of october we had premiere with our first workshop.

We started with JavaScript for absolute beginners (#jsfab) to teach people javascript. 21 learners had been found quickly. For this workshop we had 7 coaches (Ola, Leif, Hendrik, Georg, Lars, Dennis and me) to support the learners during their excercises. The location had been offered by the [StaendigeVertretung](http://www.staendigevertretungdortmund.de/), a coworking space, free of charge.

The learners had been from different backgrounds, some had already been programming in other languages, while others had been totally new to programming. With a range from ~20 to ~45 years there was also a wide spread regarding age. It was nice to see that we had a female to male ratio of 10:11.  

In the two days they were introduced to the basics of programming, like variables, types, operators, functions, control structures and loops. With those tools and provided with simplified apis they did some grapical rendering an animated html elements. Very fast the first smilies appeared, not only on the screens but also on the peoples faces.

Before lunch [Jan Lenhardt](http://twitter.com/janl) showed up to engage the people for getting into programming and to the OpenTechSchool community.

During the rest of the day the first self rendered graphs appeared. For the problems popping up the attendees came up with quite creative approaches to problems. For example rendering helper lines to each point of a graph to visually debug their code.

Saturday evening most of the people meet together again at a local pub for some socializing. So that sunday started a little bit slower and with some tired faces. But that didn't stopped them for going forward the second day. 
At the end of the day people became exhausted so that we started a small feedback session. The consensus of the learners was that everyone was happy with their achievements and had been willing to come back next time and all coaches had a lot of fun and were proud of the attendees. The course material had been very entertaining and engaging for them.

In the premliminary discussion we had fearings that with so many people in a small room, the noise would become to high for a good learning environment. But we luckily been positive surprised that it wasn't the case, cause everyone was focussed on the goregeous course material. 

Looking at those positive experiences we definately will keep on moving forward with the OpenTechSchool in Dortmund
