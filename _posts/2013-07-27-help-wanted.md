The [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org) has build incredible things over the last year and every time we tell that it is all volunteering work, people are even more astonished. And the work that has been done is amazing indeed but that doesn't mean we have enough people. It couldn't be further from the truth. **Not only are we always open for more ideas and project, we are also constantly looking for people help us implement and execute the tasks we already have on our hands.**

Right in its [core OpenTechSchool has always been about open contribution](http://www.opentechschool.org/about.html) but we only recently learnt that from the outside it looks very established, organised and well structured - basically something that doesn't need your help. Let me tell you nothing it further from the truth: we are late on many things we want to do and are always looking for help. **Tech Team** - just to name one example - is constantly late on the requests on the infrastructure coming from the community like setting up emails, handle [github orga](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/) and meetup group setups but also infrastructure and maintenance on all tech. **Help wanted**.

Or the **communications team**, highly under-staffed and unable to talk about all these great things not only the OpenTechSchool Teams all over the world are doing but also what the cool things partners and befriended organisations are up. Let alone send out information to the press in appropriate time beforehand to get the information to other groups and people we don't reach usually. Currently it is more a random [tweets](http://twitter.com/opentechschool), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OpenTechSchool) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/114834784518588736271/114834784518588736271/posts) posts and [blog posts](http://blog.opentechschool.org/) whenever there is time. If you feel you can contribute some time to this, that'd be great. **Help desperately wanted**.

And that is just a few. We have so much more to work on: workshop on conferences, workshops targeting less privileged, workshops on more topics, more hardware, more blueprints and website content, other documentation, tips and tricks helping others when setting up their OTS. And don't get me wrong, if you can only contribute a few hours a week, that is great, too. Every minute contributed to OpenTechSchool let's the movement grow.

So if you want to help out - first of all: a big thanks - just **shoot us an email** (for e.g. to [team.berlin at opentechschool dot org](mailto:team.berlin[at]opentechschool.org)) or just **come by to our next [OpenTechSchool Drinks](http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=OpenTechSchool+Drinks&events=true&eventFilter=all)**, we are doing it once a month in Berlin from now, [with the next one being this Thursday](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/130391872/).
