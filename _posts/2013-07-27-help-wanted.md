The [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org) has build incredible things over the last year and every time and when we add that it is all volunteering work, people are completely speechless. The things accomplished indeed are amazing and we are very proud of it but that doesn't mean we don't need any help. That couldn't be further from the truth. **Not only are we always open for more ideas and project, we are also constantly looking for people to help us implement and execute the tasks we already have on our hands.**

Right in its [core OpenTechSchool has always been about open contribution](http://www.opentechschool.org/about.html) but we only recently learned that from the outside it looks very established, organised and well structured - basically something that doesn't need any ones help. Let me tell you nothing it further from the truth: we are late on many things we want to do and are always looking for help. **Tech Team** - just to name one example - is constantly late on the requests on the infrastructure coming from the community like setting up emails, handle [github orga](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/) or meetup groups. **Help wanted**.

Or the **communications team**, highly under-staffed and unable to talk about all these great things not only the OpenTechSchool Teams all over the world are doing but also the cool things partners and befriended organisations are up to. Let alone send out information to the press in appropriate time beforehand to get the information to other groups and people we don't reach usually. Currently it is more a random [tweeting](http://twitter.com/opentechschool), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OpenTechSchool) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/114834784518588736271/114834784518588736271/posts) posting and [blogging](http://blog.opentechschool.org/) whenever there is time. And we know how to make it better but just don't have the people to do it. If you feel you can contribute some time to this, that'd be great and highly appreciated. **Help desperately wanted**.

Those are just a few, the most obvious, examples. We have so much more to work on: workshop on conferences, workshops targeting less privileged, workshops on more topics, more hardware, more blueprints and website content, other documentation, tips and tricks helping others when setting up their OTS. Maybe this sounds like a lot, but don't get me wrong, even if you can only have a few hours a week, that would help us a lot already - **every minute helps and is highly appreciated. And you don't need to be a hardcore techy either, there is plenty to contribute to OpenTechSchool other coaching**.

So if you want to help out - first of all: a big THANKS - please let us know: either **send us an email** to [team.berlin](mailto:team.berlin[at]opentechschool.org) or maybe **swing by our next [OpenTechSchool Drinks](http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=OpenTechSchool+Drinks&events=true&eventFilter=all)**. We are doing it once a month in Berlin from now on, with the next one taking place this Thursday. [Come by](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/130391872/) and join us for a drink and a chat.
