The [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org) has built incredible things over the last year and every time when we add that it is all volunteer work, people are completely speechless. The things accomplished indeed are amazing and we are very proud of it but that doesn't mean we don't need any help; that couldn't be further from the truth. **Not only are we always open for more ideas and projects, we are also constantly looking for people to help us implement and execute the tasks we already have on our hands.**

Right in its core [OpenTechSchool has always been about open contribution](http://www.opentechschool.org/about.html) but we only recently learned that from the outside it looks very established, organised and well structured -- basically something that doesn't need anyone's help. Let me tell you this is far from true: We are constantly running late on many things we want to do and are always looking for help. **Tech Team** -- just to name one example -- is constantly late on infrastructure requests coming from the ever-growing community like setting up emails, handle [github](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/) organisation or meetup groups. **Help wanted**.

Or the **Communications Team**, highly under-staffed and unable to talk about all these great things not only the OpenTechSchool teams all over the world are doing but also the cool things partners and befriended organisations are up to. Let alone send out information to the press in appropriate time beforehand to get the information to other groups and people we don't usually reach. Currently it is randomly [tweeting](http://twitter.com/opentechschool), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/OpenTechSchool) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/b/114834784518588736271/114834784518588736271/posts) posting and [blogging](http://blog.opentechschool.org/) whenever there is time. And we know how to make it better but just don't have the people to do it. If you feel you can contribute some time to this, that'd be great and highly appreciated. **Help desperately wanted**.

Those are just a few, the most obvious, examples. We have so much more to work on: workshops on conferences, workshops targeting less privileged, workshops on more topics, more hardware, more blueprints and website content, other documentation, tips and tricks helping others when setting up their OTS chapter. Maybe this sounds like a lot, but don't get me wrong, even if you can only spare a few hours a week, that would help us a lot already -- **every minute helps** and is highly appreciated. And you **don't need to be a hardcore techie either, there is plenty to contribute to OpenTechSchool other than coaching**.

So if you want to help out -- first of all: a big THANKS -- please let us know: Either **send us an email** to [team.berlin](mailto:team.berlin[at]opentechschool.org) or maybe **swing by our next [OpenTechSchool Drinks](http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=OpenTechSchool+Drinks&events=true&eventFilter=all)**. We are doing it once a month in Berlin from now on, with the next one taking place this Thursday. [Come by](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/130391872/) and join us for a drink and a chat.
