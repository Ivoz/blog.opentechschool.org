OpenTechSchool is becoming increasingly global, and this weekend has been a milestone to that end.  We had [Python workshops](http://python.opentechschool.org/) in [three different locations](https://twitter.com/OpenTechSchool/status/345797315841368064):  [Melbourne](http://www.meetup.com/OpenTechSchool-Melbourne/events/120751752/), [Zurich](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-zurich/events/116008182/), and [Tel Aviv](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-tel-aviv/events/123856622/).

### Melbourne

Melbourne premiered the [Introduction to Data Processing with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/) workshop in the wonderful *Electron Workshop* this time around.  One learner commented, “the material was excellent, so were the helpers.”  Plus, they had cookies.

### Zurich

Zurich had its first OpenTechSchool workshop ever, the time-tested [Python for beginners](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/).  The Colab café served as a great location on that sunny Saturday.  Participants and coaches alike were eager to have more workshops in the future:  “Good coaches, cool location. Looking forward to the next opentechschool workshop!”  And it was one of the few Zurich events which actually could get hold of a few bottles of Club Mate.

### Tel Aviv

Tel Aviv has been jumpstarted by our great core member, Ben, in just about a week.  The city in Isreal, one of our few locations with an actual coastline, kicked off with an Introduction to programming with Python.  “I wish I could learn this way every weekend,” one participant commented.
