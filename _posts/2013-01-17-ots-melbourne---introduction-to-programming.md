OpenTechSchool launches in Australia with our inaugural Introduction to Programming workshop, hosted by Electron Workshop. Join us on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/OpenTechSchool-Melbourne/events/99983172/).

Whether you've got dreams of building a software empire or you are just a little curious about what all those programmers get up to we'll give you a taste of how things work, Python-style. OpenTechSchool workshops are at-your-own-pace, with lots of coaches who are professional programmers themselves to give encouragement and guide you over the common pitfalls that many face when just starting out.

All you need to bring is a laptop and some enthusiasm! OpenTechSchool workshops are all with open-source, free software running on Mac OSX, Windows and Linux. All course material is free and hosted online.

Because the number of seats is limited, it is important that you only sign up if you definitely plan on coming (and do so, too!). If you can't make it for any reason, please cancel your attendance on Meetup right away so your someone on the waiting list can take your place. Thanks!

### About Python ###

Python is one of the most popular and widely available programming languages. With an easy syntax and friendly user base it's one of the best languages for a beginner programmer. After learning the basics, Python programmers can easily move onto graphics and multimedia, websites and data analysis. It's "batteries included" nature makes it easy to get your ideas into code, and it's a great stepping stone before moving on to other languages.
