This was the 3rd workshop in our Python series at OTS Berlin. In it we
expanded our Python knowledge with a look at
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), the popular open-source
Python framework for developing websites.

Things started getting a little more formal, with students starting to
develop in a more developer friendly Python environment. For starters,
we introduced the [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) tool, which
in combination with
[virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and
[virtualenvwrapper](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper/)
allows developers to have multiple self-contained installations of
Python on a single computer.

Django describes itself as "The Web framework for perfectionists (with
deadlines)." It was one of a new wave of open source web frameworks
released in 2005 (the other being Ruby on Rails). With a single
installation Django enables Python developers to create and manage
many websites without much code.

It really is a Swiss-army chainsaw of web development, with some very
large sites such as [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) using
it. It's certainly large enough that we could only provide a taste of
what's on offer, and we hope that our students enjoyed learning the
ins-and-outs of starting with Django.

OpenTechSchool would like to thank everyone for coming along: the
beginners and coaches and organisers and everybody else. A special
big thank you to [Co.Up](http://co-up.de/) for hosting us in their
event space. If you want to keep in touch then you can follow
OpenTechSchool on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenTechSchool) or
